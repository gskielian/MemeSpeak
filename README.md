Todo:
* create an app which allows one to collect favorite memes on one's meme dashboard, and then select them and potentially clear and edit hte text.
* Goal of this is to be very fast as to allow seamless communication without a need to speak.
* store a series of memes here, and potentially look into api integration with makeameme and like sites.





**Not to spoil anything this is just meant to be a fun program, created for friend's entertainment.
